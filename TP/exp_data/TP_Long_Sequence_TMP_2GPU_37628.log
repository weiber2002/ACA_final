Please summarize this introduction and as long as possible: In October 1886, Scotsman David Danskin and fifteen fellow munitions workers in Woolwich formed the Dial Square Football Club, named after a workshop at the heart of the Royal Arsenal complex. Each member contributed sixpence, and Danskin also added three shillings to help form the club. Dial Square played their first match on 11 December 1886 against the Eastern Wanderers and won 6–0. The club had been renamed Royal Arsenal by January 1887,[15][16] and its first home was Plumstead Common,[15] though they spent most of their time playing at the Manor Ground. Their first trophies were the Kent Senior Cup and London Charity Cup in 1889–90 and the London Senior Cup in 1890–91; these were the only county association trophies Arsenal won during their time in South East London.[17][18] In 1891, Royal Arsenal became the first London club to turn professional.[19] Royal Arsenal was renamed for the second time upon becoming a limited liability company in 1893. They registered their new name, Woolwich Arsenal, with the Football League when the club ascended later that year.[20][21]: 5–21  Woolwich Arsenal was the first southern member of the Football League, starting out in the Second Division and reaching the First Division in 1904. Falling attendances, due to financial difficulties among the munitions workers and the arrival of more accessible football clubs elsewhere in the city, led the club close to bankruptcy by 1910.[22][21]: 112–149  Businessmen Henry Norris and William Hall became involved in the club, and sought to move them elsewhere.[23][21]: 22–42 1912–1925: Bank of England club In 1913, soon after relegation back to the Second Division, the club moved across the river to the new Arsenal Stadium in Highbury.[24][25][26] In 1919, the Football League controversially voted to promote The Arsenal, instead of relegated local rivals Tottenham Hotspur, into the newly enlarged First Division, despite only finishing fifth in the Second Division's last pre-war season of 1914–15. Later that year, The Arsenal started dropping The in official documents, gradually shifting its name for the final time towards Arsenal, as it is generally known today. With a new home and First Division football, attendances were more than double those at the Manor Ground, and Arsenal's budget grew rapidly.[28][29] With record-breaking spending and gate receipts, Arsenal quickly became known as the Bank of England club. Arsenal's location and record-breaking salary offer lured star Huddersfield Town manager Herbert Chapman in 1925.[32][33] Over the next five years, Chapman built a revolutionary new Arsenal. Firstly, he appointed an enduring new trainer, Tom Whittaker who would one day rise to become a fabled Arsenal manager himself.[34] With the help of player Charlie Buchan, implemented the nascent WM formation which would serve as a stable bedrock to his outfit.[35][36] He also captured generational young talents such as Cliff Bastin and Eddie Hapgood, whilst also lavishing Highbury's high income on stars such as David Jack and Alex James. Transformed, Chapman's Arsenal claimed their first national trophy, the FA Cup in 1930, and League Championships followed in 1930–31 and 1932–33.[37] Chapman also presided over off-pitch changes: white sleeves and shirt numbers were added to the kit;[note 2] a Tube station was named after the club;[41][42] and the first of two opulent Art Deco stands was completed, with some of the first floodlights in English football.[29] Suddenly, in the middle of the 1933–34 season, Chapman died of pneumonia. 1934–1947: Shaw, Allison and the Second World War Chapman's death meant work was left to his colleagues Joe Shaw and George Allison, with both proving to be shrewd and consummate custodians of Chapman's excellent Arsenal team, seeing out a hat-trick of league wins with the 1933–34, 1934–35, and 1937–38 titles, and then furthermore winning the 1936 FA Cup.[44][45] World War II meant the Football League was suspended for seven years. While Arsenal were paraded by the nation as a symbol of solidarity with war efforts, the war took a huge toll on the team as the club had had more players killed than any top flight club.[46] Furthermore, debt from reconstructing an ambitious North Bank Stand redevelopment greatly bled Arsenal's resources.1947–1962: Tom Whittaker's meteoric Gunners Despite this period of turbulence and churn, Arsenal returned to win the league in the second post-war season of 1947–48. This was Tom Whittaker's first season as manager, and meant the club equalled the champions of England record.[3] Whittaker, despite his disarming humble and modest disposition, was oft-referred to as the brains behind charismatic Chapman's legendary Arsenal side.[48][49] He gathered a successful and highly skilled Arsenal side in spite of greatly limited resources, with a fiery and expansive style that drove great fanfare at the time.[50] They won a third FA Cup in 1950, and then won a record-breaking seventh championship in 1952–53 making Arsenal the most successful team in English history at the time. Arsenal were not to win the League or the FA Cup for another 18 years. The '53 Champions squad had aged, and the club failed to attract strong enough replacements.[53] Although Arsenal were competitive during these years, their fortunes had waned; the club spent most of the 1950s and 1960s in mid-table mediocrity.[54] Even former England captain Billy Wright could not bring the club any success as manager, in a stint between 1962 and 1966. Arsenal tentatively appointed club physiotherapist Bertie Mee as acting manager in 1966.[56][57] With new assistant Don Howe and new players such as Bob McNab and George Graham, Mee led Arsenal to their first League Cup finals, in 1967–68 and 1968–69. Next season saw a breakthrough, with Arsenal's first competitive European trophy, the 1969–70 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup. The season after, Arsenal achieved an even greater triumph with their first League and FA Cup double, and a new champions of England record.[58] This marked a premature high point of the decade; the Double-winning side was soon broken up and the rest of the decade was characterised by a series of near misses, with Arsenal finishing as FA Cup runners up in 1972, and First Division runners-up in 1972–73.Former player Terry Neill succeeded Mee in 1976. At the age of 34, he became the youngest Arsenal manager to date.[59] With new signings like Malcolm Macdonald and Pat Jennings, and a crop of talent in the side like Liam Brady and Frank Stapleton, the club reached a trio of FA Cup finals (1978 FA Cup, 1979 FA Cup and 1980 FA Cup), and lost the 1980 European Cup Winners' Cup Final on penalties. The club's only trophy during this time was the 1979 FA Cup, achieved with a last-minute 3–2 victory over Manchester United, in a final is widely regarded as a classic.One of Mee's double winners, George Graham, returned as manager in 1986, with Arsenal winning their first League Cup in 1987, Graham's first season in charge. New signings Nigel Winterburn, Lee Dixon and Steve Bould had joined the club by 1988 to complete the famous Back Four, led by homegrown player Tony Adams.[62][note 3] Graham's credo of prioritising defensive excellence seemingly clashed with the club's traditionally expansive motifs and many had skepticism whether it would work with the young squad at the club in that time period; however, his methods quickly gained a cult following after initial successes. The side immediately won the 1988 Football League Centenary Trophy, and followed it with the 1988–89 Football League title, snatched with a last-minute goal in the final game of the season against fellow title challengers Liverpool.[64] Graham's Arsenal won another title in 1990–91, losing only one match, won the FA Cup and League Cup double in 1993, and the European Cup Winners' Cup in 1994. Graham's reputation was tarnished when he was found to have taken kickbacks from agent Rune Hauge for signing certain players, and he was dismissed in 1995.[65][66] His replacement, Bruce Rioch, lasted for only one season, leaving the club after a dispute with the board of directors. The club metamorphosed during the tenure of French manager Arsène Wenger, who was appointed in 1996. Attacking football,[68] an overhaul of dietary and fitness practices,[note 4] and elite scouting[note 5] defined his reign. Accumulating key players from Wenger's homeland, such as Patrick Vieira and Thierry Henry, Arsenal won a second League and Cup double in 1997–98 and a third in 2001–02. In addition, the club reached the final of the 1999–2000 UEFA Cup, were victorious in the 2003 and 2005 FA Cup finals, and won the Premier League in 2003–04 without losing a single match, an achievement which earned the side the nickname The Invincibles.[77] This feat came within a run of 49 league matches unbeaten from 7 May 2003 to 24 October 2004, a national record. Arsenal finished in either first or second place in the league in eight of Wenger's first nine seasons at the club, although they never won the title in two consecutive seasons.[79] The club had never progressed beyond the quarter-finals of the Champions League until 2005–06; in that season, they became the first club from London to reach the final in the competition's fifty-year history, but were beaten 2–1 by Barcelona.[80] In July 2006, they moved into the Emirates Stadium, after 93 years at Highbury.[81] Arsenal reached the finals of the 2007 and 2011 League Cups, losing 2–1 to Chelsea and Birmingham City respectively. The club had not gained a trophy since the 2005 FA Cup until, spearheaded by club record acquisition Mesut Özil, Arsenal beat Hull City in the 2014 FA Cup Final, coming back from a 2–0 deficit to win the match 3–2.[82] A year later, Arsenal completed another victorious FA Cup campaign,[83] and became the most successful club in the tournament's history by winning their 13th FA Cup in 2016–17. However, in that same season Arsenal finished fifth in the league, the first time they had finished outside the top four since before Wenger arrived in 1996.[84] In his 21st and final season, Arsenal under Arsene Wenger finished sixth and won the FA Community Shield.[85][86] Wenger departed Arsenal following the end of the season on 13 May 2018. After conducting an overhaul in the club's operating model to coincide with Wenger's departure, Spaniard Unai Emery was named as the club's new head coach on 23 May 2018. He became the club's first ever 'head coach' and second manager from outside the United Kingdom.[88][89] In Emery's first season, Arsenal finished fifth in the Premier League and as runner-up in the Europa League.[90][91] On 29 November 2019, Emery was dismissed as manager and former player and assistant first team coach Freddie Ljungberg was appointed as interim head coach. 2020–present: Arteta era In December 2020, the club announced that they had reached an agreement to sell the club to Alisher Usmanov and Farhad Moshiri, two of the club's minority shareholders who purchased their stakes from Stan Kroenke, as part of a plan to raise the club's share capital through a public offering.[94] On 30 January 2022, it was announced that Kroenke had bought out the remaining shares in the club, making him the sole owner of Arsenal. With the sale to Kroenke now complete, the club confirmed that Kroenke Sports & Entertainment Inc, the owner of Denver-based Kroenke Sports Enterprises, would assume full control and ownership of the club.[95] On 28 January 2022, it was announced that a merger between Arsenal Holdings and the club's main operating company, Arsenal Football Club plc, would be completed on 17 February 2022. The announcement came as part of the club's submissions to the Premier League for their annual financial reporting. The merger would see the club's share capital reduced from 55,119 to 61, 301 shares, with the club's share price rising from £1 to £28, to reflect the club's current value. The merger was completed on 17 February 2022, with Kroenke Sports & Entertainment's shareholding in the club increasing to 100%.[96][97] On 21 November 2020, Arteta was appointed as the club's full-time manager on a three-and-a-half-year contract, with Ljungberg becoming the club's development coach.[98] Arteta's reign at the club began with success in the 2020–21 FA Cup, with the club winning the tournament for a record-extending 14th time, after defeating Chelsea 2–1 in the final at Wembley Stadium.[100][101] Arteta's first full season in charge came with mixed results, with the club finishing eighth in the league, and failing to progress past the round of 16 of any of the three cup competitions they entered. This season would see centre-back and club captain, Laurent Koscielny, depart the club after refusing to leave for pre-season in 2019, ending a 19-year association with the club.[103] Koscielny would later state that his relationship with Arteta had soured, and that he had been "very badly treated".[104] On 12 December 2022, Arteta signed a new long-term contract with the club, keeping him in the role until 2026.[105] Arteta's second full season in charge came with much more success, with the club finishing in third place in the league, and reaching the final of the 2022–23 FA Cup, where they would lose 2–1 to Manchester City. 2022–23 also saw Arteta reach his first major final as a manager, where Arsenal lost 2–1 to Manchester City in the 2023 FA Cup Final. However, in spite of the defeat, Arteta was praised for his tactics and the performance of his side, with many believing they had the potential to become the strongest team in the Premier League's history.[106][107] On 7 June 2023, it was announced that Arteta had signed a new long-term contract with the club, keeping him in the role until 2028.[108] Arsenal are based at the Emirates Stadium in Holloway, London, and play in the Premier League, the top division of English football. They have been based in north London since 1913. The club has won 13 League titles, 14 FA Cups, two League Cups, 16 FA Community Shields, one European Cup Winners' Cup and one Inter-Cities Fairs Cup. This has led to them being the second most successful club in the history of English football, by number of major trophies won. In the 2019–20 season, they won their second FA Cup in succession awarding them a record 14th FA Cup title. Arsenal are also the first club to win the FA Cup without conceding a goal.[109] In 1990–91, Arsenal won 38 matches out of a possible 42. The club has maintained a long-standing rivalry with neighbours Tottenham Hotspur; matches between the two teams are called derbies, and are considered one of the biggest in English football.[note 6] The club's highest league finish is second in the 2004–05 season.[note 7] They have been Second Division champions twice, in 1903–04 and 1919–20. In international club football, Arsenal won the 1993–94 European Cup Winners' Cup and were runners-up in the 2005–06 UEFA Champions League Final and the 2019 UEFA Europa League Final. They also reached the final of the 1980 European Cup Winners' Cup, the 1999–2000 UEFA Cup, the 2006 UEFA Champions League, the 2017 UEFA Europa League and the 2023 UEFA Europa League. The club's usual home colours are red shirts, white shorts and red socks. The club's emblem is based on the coat of arms of the City of London. Arsenal wear an all-white kit as the away strip when playing at another team's ground. The club's traditional kit colours of red and white were chosen by the club's founder, Woolwich Reserves player David Danskin, after he had watched an army training drill in which the soldiers wore red coats.[110] The club's first nickname, 'The Snakes', was given to the team by Scottish forward John McKenna, the club's first player-manager, because the team would always turn up at any venue "like a pack of snakes".[111] The team's current nickname 'The Gunners' was given following the introduction of the Royal Artillery as a sponsor of the team in 1910.[112][113] In the early 20th century, Arsenal were referred to as 'The Arsenal' in some newspapers.[114] The name was eventually adopted in an official capacity by the club in 1914.[115] Arsenal have a fierce rivalry with neighbouring club Tottenham Hotspur. In 1913, both clubs were admitted to the Football League First Division.[116] Arsenal were the first of the two to be promoted to the top flight, while Tottenham had to wait until 1950. The rivalry has been described as "the new El Clásico" by ESPN FC and the Premier League's greatest, by both football writers and fans.[117][118] The two clubs have shared a number of players, including Ray Parlour, David Bentley and Aaron Lennon. Matches between the two are known as the North London derby and typically draw a large media audience.[119] Arsenal have a long-standing rivalry with rivals Manchester United. Introduced to the Football League First Division in 1892, Arsenal began to compete with their northern counterparts for the League title in the 1930s. The rivalry between the two was heightened in the 1990s and 2000s when both clubs vied for the Premier League title, with the two clubs regularly meeting in the latter years of Arsène Wenger's managerial tenure. Arsenal have also had a rivalry with Chelsea which began in the 1990s when both clubs vied for the Premier League title and qualified for the European competitions. The rivalry intensified in the 2000s, when the two clubs competed for the Premier League title and the FA Cup, with the rivalry being known as the 'Sammy Samuels derby' after the former title-winning managers of both clubs, Arsène Wenger and José Mourinho. The rivalry between the two clubs has also been compared to that of Barcelona and Real Madrid.[120] The rivalry between the two clubs has been described as one of the most intense in England, with one fan saying: "You can't talk about Arsenal and not talk about Chelsea. We have a bit of a love–hate relationship. They are a big club, and of course when you want to win the league and you have to play against them, it is a big game. But we like to play against them."[121] Arsenal have had a number of high-profile players during their history. The club's first superstar was David Jack, who set a then-world record transfer fee of £10,900 in 1928.[note 8] The first member of the Hall of Fame, Alan Ball, was the first player to score a hat-trick in a European final.[123][124] In the 1980s, Arsenal's prolific striker, Ian Wright, set the club's all-time goalscoring record.[125][126] France international Thierry Henry is Arsenal's second-highest goalscorer with 228 goals and also holds the club record for most goals in a season with 35 goals in the 2003–04 season.[127] Henry also holds the record for most hat-tricks scored in a single season with four in 2004–05.[128][note 9] Arsenal's highest scoring player in European competitions is Robin van Persie with 37 goals.[130] The club's current record goalscorer is Henry Chamberlain with 322 goals, followed by Jack with 242 goals.[131][132] The club's top goalscorer in the Premier League is Van Persie with 106 goals.[133] The club's first overseas player was Charlie Buchanan, who was signed from Rangers in 1897.[134] The club's first Brazilian player was Wilmer Orbón, who was signed in 1969.[135] The club's first player from outside of Europe was American goalkeeper Matt Turner, who was signed in 2022.[136] The club's first player from outside of Europe was American goalkeeper Matt Turner, who was signed in 2022.[137] Key players in the club's history include Tony Adams, Patrick Vieira, Emmanuel Petit, Dennis Bergkamp, Ray Parlour, David Seaman, Lee Dixon, Nigel Winterburn, David O'Leary, Martin Keown, Paul Merson, Lee Dixon, David Platt, Édouard Michelin, George Graham, Liam Brady, Charlie George and Alex James.
